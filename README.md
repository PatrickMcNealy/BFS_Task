This is my interview task for BFS.

As requested, this is a demonstration of an NPC with a state machine picking up and organizing boxes by color.  It includes demonstration of 2D colliders with gravity on bumpy terrain.

I also wanted to demonstrate my understanding of object pooling, coroutines, prefab variants, assemblies, and namespaces.
